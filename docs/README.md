# website-built-by-ai
This project is built using react, spring boot and Postgres SQL on intellij. It is built according to our past knowledge in full-stack and the ability of ai (in this case: chat-gpt) to complete all of the tasks of building a functional website, the website has only two pages a form and a summary page.

For the full Summary about how I built this website, screenshots of chat-gpt conversations and other sources, please read the word document (FULLEXPLANATION.docx) provided in the *docs* folder.
